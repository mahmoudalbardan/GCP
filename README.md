## Google Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub, short for Publish/Subscribe, is a messaging pattern and communication paradigm used in distributed systems. It allows decoupling of components in a system by enabling communication between them without requiring the components to be aware of each other. In a Pub/Sub system, message senders (publishers) and message receivers (subscribers) are independent entities.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts in Pub/Sub:

1. **Publisher:**
   - A publisher is an entity that generates and sends messages to a central message broker or a topic in the Pub/Sub system.
   - The publisher's responsibility is to create and transmit messages containing relevant information or events.

2. **Subscriber:**
   - A subscriber is an entity that expresses interest in receiving messages on a particular topic or channel.
   - Subscribers receive messages that are relevant to the topics they have subscribed to.

3. **Message Broker/Topic:**
   - The message broker (or topic) acts as an intermediary between publishers and subscribers.
   - Publishers send messages to specific topics, and subscribers express interest in specific topics. The message broker ensures that messages are delivered to the appropriate subscribers.

4. **Decoupling:**
   - Pub/Sub enables loose coupling between components in a system. Publishers and subscribers are independent, and they don't need to know each other's existence.
   - This decoupling allows for more flexible and scalable architectures.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Pub/Sub systems are designed to scale horizontally, handling a large number of publishers and subscribers and efficiently delivering messages to relevant recipients.

6. **Asynchronous Communication:**
   - Pub/Sub operates on an asynchronous communication model. Publishers send messages without waiting for immediate responses from subscribers.
   - This is particularly useful in scenarios where components can operate independently, and real-time interactions are not required.

7. **Reliability:**
   - Pub/Sub systems often provide mechanisms for ensuring reliable message delivery, such as acknowledgments. Acknowledgments allow subscribers to confirm that they have received and processed a message.

Popular implementations of Pub/Sub systems include:

- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub:** A fully-managed messaging service provided by Google Cloud, allowing scalable and flexible communication between components in a cloud environment.

- **Apache Kafka:** An open-source distributed streaming platform that can be used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** A lightweight, open, and widely used messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.

These implementations may have different features and use cases, but they all share the fundamental principles of Pub/Sub.

### Example of Pub/Sub
Let's consider a simplified example to illustrate the usage of a Pub/Sub system in the context of a real-world scenario. Suppose you are building an e-commerce platform, and you want to implement a notification system to inform users about product updates.

1. **Scenario:**
   - You have a product catalog where sellers can update product details, such as price changes, stock availability, or new arrivals.
   - Users who are interested in specific products want to receive notifications when there are updates to those products.

2. **Implementation with Pub/Sub:**

   - **Publishers:**
     - Sellers, or the backend system, act as publishers. They generate messages containing information about product updates and publish these messages to relevant topics in the Pub/Sub system.

   - **Subscribers:**
     - Users interested in specific products act as subscribers. They subscribe to topics related to the products they want to track.

   - **Message Broker/Topic:**
     - The Pub/Sub system acts as the message broker. It provides topics for different product categories (e.g., "Electronics," "Clothing," etc.).

   - **Workflow:**
     - Sellers publish messages to the corresponding topics whenever there is a product update. For example, if the price of a smartphone changes, a message is published to the "Electronics" topic.
     - Users interested in electronics subscribe to the "Electronics" topic.
     - The Pub/Sub system ensures that when a message is published to a topic, it is delivered to all subscribers interested in that topic.

3. **Result:**
   - Users receive notifications in near real-time when there are updates to the products they are interested in, without the need for direct communication between sellers and users.

4. **Benefits:**
   - **Scalability:** The system can handle a large number of sellers and users.
   - **Decoupling:** Sellers and users don't need to be aware of each other. Sellers can update products without knowing who is interested in them.
   - **Asynchronous:** Sellers can continue with their updates without waiting for users to receive notifications.

This example demonstrates how a Pub/Sub system can be used to implement an efficient and scalable notification system in a decoupled architecture. It allows for flexibility in updating products and notifying users without creating tight dependencies between different components of the system.

## Regions, Zones, Oranisations, Folders and Projects
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) uses a hierarchical structure to organize resources. Let's go through the key concepts in GCP:

### 1. **Organization:**
- An organization is the top-level resource in GCP. It represents a GCP customer, and it contains all other GCP resources. An organization is associated with a Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) domain.

### 2. **Folder:**
- Folders are used to group projects and resources within an organization. Folders provide a way to organize resources based on department, teams, or applications. Folders can contain projects, other folders, and resources.

### 3. **Project:**
- A project is a fundamental resource in GCP. It serves as a container for resources like virtual machines, storage buckets, databases, and more. Each project has a unique ID, a user-defined name, and a project number.

### 4. **Regions:**
- A region is a specific geographical location where GCP resources are hosted. GCP has multiple regions worldwide, and each region contains multiple zones. Regions are used to determine the physical location of your resources for redundancy and latency considerations.

### 5. **Zones:**
- Zones are isolated locations within regions. Each zone within a region is independent of the others, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. GCP resources are often deployed across multiple zones to ensure high availability.

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Organizational Hierarchy

- **Organization:**
  - Example: `mycompany.com`
  
- **Folders:**
  - `Engineering`
  - `Sales`
  
- **Projects within "Engineering" Folder:**
  - `Project A`
  - `Project B`

- **Projects within "Sales" Folder:**
  - `Sales App`
  - `Sales Analytics`

#### Example 2: Project with Resources

- **Project:**
  - Name: `MyProject`
  - ID: `my-project-id`
  - Number: `123456789`

- **Resources within "MyProject":**
  - Compute Engine instances
  - Cloud Storage bucket
  - Cloud SQL database
  - BigQuery dataset

#### Example 3: Regions and Zones

- **Regions:**
  - `us-central1` (Iowa)
  - `europe-west1` (Belgium)

- **Zones within `us-central1`:**
  - `us-central1-a`
  - `us-central1-b`
  - `us-central1-c`

- **Zones within `europe-west1`:**
  - `europe-west1-a`
  - `europe-west1-b`
  - `europe-west1-c`

#### Example 4: Multi-Region Deployment

- **Regions:**
  - `us-east1` (South Carolina)
  - `asia-southeast1` (Singapore)

- **Zones within `us-east1`:**
  - `us-east1-a`
  - `us-east1-b`
  - `us-east1-c`

- **Zones within `asia-southeast1`:**
  - `asia-southeast1-a`
  - `asia-southeast1-b`
  - `asia-southeast1-c`

In this example, resources are deployed in multiple regions and zones for redundancy and high availability. The project structure is organized under an organization or folders, and resources are distributed across regions and zones based on the desired architecture.

The hierarchical structure helps in organizing and managing resources effectively, especially in large-scale environments with multiple projects and teams. It also facilitates resource access control and policy management through Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings.

## What is High availability Fault tolerance and low latency in GCP ?
In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency are critical considerations for designing and deploying reliable and performant applications. Let's define these terms in the context of GCP:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Choosing the right instance type for your workload can optimize costs. For example, using memory-optimized instances for memory-intensive tasks.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Selecting instance types that align with the scalability requirements of your workload. Compute-intensive workloads may benefit from horizontal scaling (adding more instances).

3. **Performance Requirements:**
   - Understanding the performance characteristics of your workload is crucial. Memory-intensive workloads may benefit from instances with higher memory capacity, while compute-intensive workloads may need instances with powerful CPUs.

4. **Resource Specialization:**
   - Some workloads, like machine learning or graphics processing, benefit from specialized hardware accelerators. In such cases, choosing instances with GPUs or TPUs can significantly improve performance.

5. **Workload Dynamics:**
   - Consider how your workload scales over time and whether it has variable resource demands. For example, burstable instances may be suitable for workloads with intermittent high CPU requirements.

Cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer a variety of instance types and services tailored to different workload characteristics. By understanding the nature of your workload, you can make informed decisions when selecting the appropriate cloud resources to meet your performance, scalability, and cost requirements.

## Billing account organisation in GCP
In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), billing accounts are organized hierarchically to help manage and allocate costs efficiently. The billing hierarchy consists of the following components:

1. **Billing Account:**
   - A billing account is the highest level of the billing hierarchy. It represents the financial relationship between an organization and Google Cloud. A billing account is linked to a Google Cloud Console project and is used to pay for the resources used within that project.

2. **Organization:**
   - An organization is a container for resources and projects. It is a higher-level entity that provides a way to organize and manage your Google Cloud resources. An organization can have multiple billing accounts associated with it.

3. **Folder:**
   - Folders are used to organize resources within an organization. Folders can contain projects, other folders, and resources. Folders can have their billing settings, allowing for more granular control over costs within an organization.

4. **Project:**
   - A project is a fundamental GCP resource that represents an application or service. Each project is associated with a billing account and has its own set of resources, permissions, and settings.

### Key Points:

- **Billing Account and Project Association:**
  - Each project in GCP must be linked to a billing account, and costs associated with the project are billed to that billing account.

- **Billing Account and Organization Association:**
  - A billing account can be associated with a specific organization. This association allows for a consolidated view of costs and usage across multiple projects within the organization.

- **Billing Account and Folder Association:**
  - Folders can have their billing settings. This allows you to manage costs at a more granular level within an organization by assigning billing accounts to specific folders.

- **Permissions:**
  - Permissions within the billing hierarchy are inherited downward. For example, if a user has permissions on a project, they also have permissions on the billing account associated with that project.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a scenario where an organization has multiple projects, each associated with its billing account. The organization might further organize projects into folders based on departments or teams. This hierarchical structure allows for effective cost management and resource organization.

It's essential to carefully plan and organize your billing hierarchy to align with your organization's structure and cost allocation requirements. This helps in efficiently managing costs, permissions, and resources within GCP.

| **IAM Overview**                   | Identity and Access Management (IAM) in GCP uses policies with members (individuals, groups, service accounts) and roles (permissions).                                                                                              |
| **Human Users vs. Service Accounts** | Human users authenticate with credentials tied to their lifecycle, making them unsuitable for non-human operations. Service accounts are created for specific tasks and use keys for authentication.                                   |
| **Advantages of Service Accounts** | Service accounts are safer for programmatic access, as their credentials can be easily rotated. They provide granular level authorization for specific tasks.                                                                          |
| **Service Account Use Case**       | Service accounts can limit damage if an application is compromised. For example, compute VMs can run with specified user-managed service accounts instead of default ones.                                                            |
| **Authentication with Service Accounts** | Google-managed service accounts handle key management automatically. User-managed service accounts require generating and downloading keys for authentication. These keys are powerful and must be handled carefully.                   |
| **Best Practices**                 | Use IAM roles instead of ACLs for cloud storage access. Roles like Storage Object Creator, Viewer, and Admin grant various permissions. ACLs provide specific permissions (reader, writer, owner) on buckets and objects.              |
| **Conclusion**                     | Leverage IAM and service accounts to automate and secure access. Follow the principle of least privilege and refer to GCP documentation for detailed guidance.                                                                          |

# Google's Cloud Pub/Sub Overview

## Introduction
Google's Cloud Pub/Sub handles messaging and event ingestion at a global level. It helps decouple services, enhancing system resilience and reducing dependencies.

## Messaging Middleware
Without messaging middleware, direct communication between components can create dependencies, leading to system failures if any part breaks. Messaging middleware, like Pub/Sub, introduces a message bus that handles messages between components, decoupling services and improving resilience.

## Pub/Sub Model
Pub/Sub uses a publish/subscribe model, splitting messages into topics. Publishers send messages to these topics, and subscribers receive messages from them. This supports asynchronous communication and reduces dependency between services.

## Benefits of Pub/Sub
- **Global, Fully-Managed Service:** Pub/Sub is a serverless, NoOps service, requiring no provisioning.
- **High Scalability:** Google’s internal Pub/Sub handles massive volumes of messages, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **Multiple Publisher/Subscriber Patterns:** Supports various patterns such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
- **At-Least-Once Delivery:** Ensures messages are delivered at least once, with minimal chances of duplication.
- **Real-Time and Batch Processing:** Can handle both real-time and batch message processing, with exponential backoff for publishing and push subscriptions.
- **Integration with Cloud Dataflow:** Supports advanced time windowing and exactly-once processing.
- **Versatile Use Cases:** Suitable for distributing workloads, asynchronous workflows, event notifications, distributed logging, and device data streaming.

## Common Use Cases
- **Distributing Workloads:** Queuing tasks in a Pub/Sub topic for distributed processing.
- **Asynchronous Workflows:** Controlling the order of events in loosely coupled systems.
- **Event Notifications:** Notifying systems of new events, such as user registrations.
- **Distributed Logging:** Sending logs to a Pub/Sub topic to be consumed by multiple subscribers.
- **Device Data Streaming:** Streaming data or telemetry from internet-connected devices to Pub/Sub topics for on-demand consumption.

## Patterns for Implementing Pub/Sub Messaging
- **One-to-One Pattern:** A single publisher sends messages to a topic, and a single subscriber receives messages from the topic.
- **One-to-Many Pattern:** A single publisher sends messages to a topic, and multiple subscribers receive messages from the topic, each via their own subscription.
- **Many-to-One Pattern:** Multiple publishers send messages to a single topic, and one subscriber receives messages from the topic.
- **Many-to-Many Pattern:** Multiple publishers send messages to multiple topics, and multiple subscribers receive messages from those topics.

## Publishing and Receiving Messages
- **Publishing Messages:** Create a message with your data (JSON payload, base64 encoded) and send it to the Pub/Sub API, specifying the topic.
- **Receiving Messages:** Create a subscription to a topic. Subscriptions can use pull (default) or push delivery methods. In pull, you request messages from the API. In push, messages are automatically sent to a specified HTTPS endpoint.

## Integration with GCP Services
- **Cloud DataFlow:** Supports advanced time windowing and exactly-once processing using Apache Beam SDK.
- **Cloud Functions & Cloud Run:** Use Pub/Sub events to trigger Cloud Functions or receive push subscriptions in Cloud Run.
- **Cloud IoT Core:** Receives messages and events from connected devices for processing by other GCP services.

## Local Development
For local development, a Pub/Sub emulator is available. Requires Google Cloud SDK and Java Runtime Environment (version 7 or above).
By using Google's Cloud Pub/Sub, you can ensure a resilient, scalable, and flexible messaging system for your applications, integrating seamlessly with other GCP services.

| Feature               | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**      | Cost-effective, zonal messaging service with lower latency guarantees.                                                                                         |
| **Use Cases**         | Designed for cost-sensitive use cases that can tolerate zonal availability. Suitable for batch processing and streaming analytics where lower costs are important. |
| **Scalability**       | Users need to provision and manage throughput capacity explicitly.                                                                                             |
| **Availability**      | Provides zonal availability; not designed for multi-region replication or high availability.                                                                   |
| **Cost**              | Lower and more predictable costs due to provisioning of capacity and storage separately. Suitable for large-scale, cost-sensitive workloads.                    |
| **Message Retention** | Users can configure message retention duration. Retention is primarily limited by the amount of storage provisioned.                                             |
| **Ordering**          | Supports message ordering within a specific topic.                                                                                                             |
| **Use Case Examples** | Batch processing, streaming analytics, cost-sensitive workloads, data archival.                                                                                |
| **Features**          | Simplified cost management, zonal isolation.                                                                                                                   |

# Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Filtering, Ordering, and Dead Lettering

### Filtering

Filtering in Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows you to selectively deliver messages to subscribers based on specified criteria. This is achieved using subscription filters, which are expressions that evaluate message attributes.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Subscription Filters**: Boolean expressions defined when creating a subscription to a topic.
- **Message Attributes**: Key-value pairs in Pub/Sub messages used in filters.
- **Filtering Logic**: Messages evaluated against filters; delivered if criteria met.

**Use Cases:**

- **Selective Message Consumption**: Deliver messages based on attributes (e.g., type, timestamp).
- **Partitioning Topics**: Segment topics for different subscribers.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a `user-events` topic:
- Subscription A: `eventType = 'click'`
- Subscription B: `eventType = 'purchase'`

### Ordering

Ordering ensures messages are delivered in the sequence they were published, critical for maintaining application state.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Ordered Delivery**: Messages delivered in exact order of publishing.
- **Sequence Numbers**: Unique identifiers for message order.
- **Performance Considerations**: Slight latency increase; throughput limitations.

**Use Cases:**

- **Event Sequencing**: Maintain accurate event sequence.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Execute tasks in initiation order.

**Example:**

In a financial platform:
- Process market data updates sequentially for accurate trading decisions.

### Dead Lettering

Dead lettering handles undeliverable messages after repeated delivery attempts, moving them to a separate topic for analysis or reprocessing.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Dead-Letter Topic**: Receives failed messages after max delivery attempts.
- **Redelivery Policy**: Configurable max attempts before moving to dead-letter topic.
- **Error Handling**: Investigate and correct processing failures.

**Use Cases:**

- **Error Investigation**: Analyze failed messages for root causes.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Retry transient errors without blocking indefinitely.

**Example:**

In an e-commerce platform:
- Redirect order processing errors to `order-errors` for review and resolution.

### Summary

Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides robust features for building scalable and reliable event-driven architectures:
- **Filtering**: Selective message delivery based on attributes.
- **Ordering**: Sequential message delivery to maintain application logic.
- **Dead Lettering**: Handling and analyzing undeliverable messages for error resolution.
